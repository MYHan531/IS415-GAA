## **3 Overview**

Spatial Point Pattern Analysis is the evaluation of the pattern or distribution, of a set of points on a surface. The point can be location of:

-   events such as crime, traffic accident and disease onset, or

-   business services (coffee and fastfood outlets) or facilities such as childcare and eldercare.

Using appropriate functions of [spatstat](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spatstat/), this hands-on exercise aims to discover the spatial point processes of childecare centres in Singapore.

## 3.1 The specific questions we would like to answer are as follows:

-   are the childcare centres in Singapore randomly distributed throughout the country?

-   if the answer is not, then the next logical question is where are the locations with higher concentration of childcare centres?

## **3.2 The data**

To provide answers to the questions above, three data sets will be used. They are:

-   `CHILDCARE`, a point feature data providing both location and attribute information of childcare centres. It was downloaded from Data.gov.sg and is in geojson format.

-   `MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL`, a polygon feature data providing information of URA 2014 Master Plan Planning Subzone boundary data. It is in ESRI shapefile format. This data set was also downloaded from Data.gov.sg.

-   `CostalOutline`, a polygon feature data showing the national boundary of Singapore. It is provided by SLA and is in ESRI shapefile format.

## **3.3 Installing and Loading the R packages**

In this hands-on exercise, five R packages will be used, they are:

-   [**sf**](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/), a relatively new R package specially designed to import, manage and process vector-based geospatial data in R.

-   [**spatstat**](https://spatstat.org/), which has a wide range of useful functions for point pattern analysis. In this hands-on exercise, it will be used to perform 1st- and 2nd-order spatial point patterns analysis and derive kernel density estimation (KDE) layer.

-   [**raster**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/raster/) which reads, writes, manipulates, analyses and model of gridded spatial data (i.e.Â raster). In this hands-on exercise, it will be used to convert image output generate by spatstat into raster format.

-   [**maptools**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/maptools/index.html) which provides a set of tools for manipulating geographic data. In this hands-on exercise, we mainly use it to convert *Spatial* objects into *ppp* format of **spatstat**.

-   [**tmap**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmap/index.html) which provides functions for plotting cartographic quality static point patterns maps or interactive maps by using [leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) API.

Use the code chunk below to install and launch the five R packages.

```{r}
install.packages("maptools", repos = "https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/2023-10-13")
```

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tmap, sf, tidyverse, raster, spatstat, maptools, sp)
```
