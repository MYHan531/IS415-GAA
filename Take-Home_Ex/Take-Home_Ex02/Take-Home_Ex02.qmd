## Introduction

In this analysis, we explore the spatial distribution of drug use in Thailand from 2017 to 2022 using geospatial data and analysis methods. Drug abuse remains a significant social issue, particularly among youth, with the number of users continuing to rise. This exercise leverages geographic information system (GIS) tools to explore how drug use patterns are distributed across Thailand's provinces and whether spatial dependencies exist in these patterns.

Thailand’s geopolitical position near the Golden Triangle, a major drug-producing region, further complicates its drug abuse situation. This study aims to identify spatial correlations, clusters, outliers, and hotspots in drug use cases over time.

# **Overview**

This take-home exercise focuses on the application of geospatial analysis methods to explore and analyze the spatial distribution of drug abuse in Thailand at the provincial level from 2017 to 2022. We aim to detect spatial clusters, outliers, and hotspots, while also assessing how these trends evolve over time. By leveraging global and local spatial autocorrelation methods, we aim to uncover key patterns in the distribution of drug use cases in Thailand.

## **Data used**

For this study, two main data sources were utilized: - **Thailand Drug Offenses (2017-2022)**, sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) - **Thailand Subnational Administrative Boundaries**, sourced from [HDX](https://data.humdata.org/dataset)

These datasets provided the necessary drug abuse indicators at the provincial level and the geographical boundaries required for the spatial analysis.

Tools used: - **sf**: for managing and manipulating geospatial data. - **tidyverse**: for general data wrangling and visualization. - **sfdep**: for performing spatial autocorrelation analysis.

## **Installing and Loading the R Packages**

Before proceeding with the analysis, it is essential to install and load the required R packages:

-   [`sf`](https://rdrr.io/github/r-spatial/sf/man/sf-package.html) : provides a standardised way to encode spatial vector data in R environment, facilitating spatial data operations and analysis.

-   [`st`](https://rdrr.io/cran/sf/man/st.html) : creats simple features from numeric vectors, matrices, or lists, enabling the representation and manipulation of spatial structures in R.

-   [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/) : a collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structure.

-   [`sfdep`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spdep/) : for computing spatial weights, global and local spatial autocorrelation statistics

-   [`tmap`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmap/) : for creating static and interactive visualisations and maps.

-   [`ggplot2`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/) : for creating advanced visualisations, graphics and maps using the Grammar of Graphics.

```{r}
# Install and load necessary packages
pacman::p_load(sf, tidyverse, sfdep, tmap, readr, ggplot2, spdep)
```

## **Importing and Transforming Geospatial Data**

In this section, `st_read()` of **sf** package will be used to import **`THALILAND_BORDERS_2022`** dataset into R environment.

```{r}

adm0 <- st_read("data/geospatial/tha_admbnda_adm0_rtsd_20220121.shp")
adm1 <- st_read("data/geospatial/tha_admbnda_adm1_rtsd_20220121.shp")

# Display the structure of the datasets
# glimpse(adm0)
# glimpse(adm1)
```

We will verify the coordinate reference systems of the tainan object to ensure the assignment of the correct CRS value. WGS 84 should be the correct reference.

```{r}
st_crs(adm1)
```

Next, we will generate a plot of the adm1 object to visualise its structure.

```{r}
tmap_mode("plot")
tm_shape(adm1)+
  tm_fill(col="white")+
  tm_borders(col = "black", lwd=0.3, alpha=0.6)+
  tm_layout(
    main.title = "Regions (Thailand)",
    main.title.size = 1,
    main.title.position = "center",
    legend.show = FALSE,
     frame = FALSE)
```

## **Importing Aspatial Data**

In this section, `read_csv()` of **sf** package will be used to import the csv file into R environment. The output is R dataframe class.

```{r}
drug_data <- read_csv("data/aspatial/thai_drug_offenses_2017_2022.csv")
# glimpse(drug_data)
```

## **Spatial Data Wrangling**

Next, we merge the drug abuse data with the spatial dataset for Thailand provinces to prepare it for analysis.

### Inspect and Clean the Data

Before merging, inspect the data to make sure the columns that should match (province names) are consistent in both datasets. If needed, clean and standardize the province names to avoid issues during the join.

The importance of cleaning the data is crucial for this assessment, in the aspatial dataset, the naming of the provinces in english is slightly different from the geospatial dataset, for example: "Loburi" in drug_data is actually "Lop Buri" in adm1. If we do a left join, they will treat them as two separate locations instead of the intended one.

```{r}
library(dplyr)

drug_data <- drug_data %>%
  mutate(
    province_en = recode(province_en, 
                         "buogkan" = "Bueng Kan",
                         "Loburi" = "Lop Buri")
  )

head(drug_data)
```

Then, merge the `drug_data` with the `adm1` shapefile using the `left_join()` function, with `province_en` from `drug_data` matching `ADM1_EN` from the `adm1` dataset.

```{r}
# Inspect unique province names in both datasets
# unique(drug_data$province_en)
# unique(adm1$ADM1_EN)


# Perform the join on province_en and ADM1_EN
drug_data_sf <- adm1 %>% 
  left_join(drug_data, by = c("ADM1_EN" = "province_en"))


# Check if the total number of provinces matches both datasets
unique(drug_data_sf$ADM1_EN)

# drug_data_sf <- drug_data_sf %>%
#   filter(ADM1_EN != "Phetchabun")

```

List down the unique types of drug offences, if there are NA values in it, remove them:

```{r}
unique(drug_data_sf$types_of_drug_offenses)
```

For this analysis, I would focus on the **“trafficking_cases”** and **“possession_with_intent_to_distribute_cases”**. Here's the reasoning behind this choice:

### Justification for Choosing:

1.  **Trafficking Cases**:

    -   **Relevance**: Drug trafficking is often a key indicator of organized crime and the movement of narcotics across regions. It reflects not only local consumption but also broader patterns of supply and demand, often linked to cross-border activities. In the case of Thailand, which is geographically near the **Golden Triangle** (a major drug-producing region), analyzing trafficking cases can help highlight key transit routes or areas where trafficking is prevalent.

    -   **Informative**: By focusing on trafficking, we can uncover patterns in regions that might be heavily involved in the movement of drugs, either within Thailand or across borders. This can help identify provinces that serve as major conduits for the drug trade.

2.  **Possession with Intent to Distribute Cases**:

    -   **Relevance**: This category indicates individuals caught with drugs intended for sale or distribution, which can be an early-stage indicator of trafficking operations within regions. It helps identify not just end-users but those involved in drug distribution networks.

    -   **Informative**: Combining this category with trafficking cases gives a more complete picture of drug-related activity, as it includes both small-scale distribution and larger trafficking operations.

### Analysis Workflow:

We will focus on visualizing and analyzing both **trafficking cases** and **possession with intent to distribute cases** to see how they are spatially distributed across provinces. This will help identify high-risk areas for drug movement and distribution within Thailand.

### Handle Missing Data

Sometimes, the join might not find matches for all provinces. You should check for `NA` values and decide how to handle them (e.g., remove rows, fill missing values, etc.).

```{r}
# Check for missing values after the join
missing_provinces <- drug_data_sf %>% filter(is.na(fiscal_year))
print(missing_provinces)
```

### Preparing the Spatial Data for Analysis

Now that the data is merged, it’s ready for further spatial analysis such as global and local spatial autocorrelation, visualization, or clustering.

### Check if data is in `sf`  format for Visualization

We’ll primarily work with the **`sf`** object for visualization, but convert it to **`sp`** for spatial autocorrelation tasks.

```{r}
# Use sf for visualization
class(drug_data_sf)
```

### Example Workflow:

1.  **Data Exploration**: Explore the number of drug cases across provinces and over time.

2.  **Data Aggregation**: You might want to aggregate the data by `fiscal_year` to calculate statistics such as total drug cases per province over the years.

```{r}
# Function to split the data by offense type and year
split_data_by_year_type <- function(data, offense_type) {
  
  filtered_data <- data %>%
    filter(types_of_drug_offenses == offense_type) %>%
    select_if(~ any(!is.na(.)))  # Remove columns that are entirely NA
  
  years <- unique(filtered_data$fiscal_year)
  
  for (year in years) {
    # Filter data for each year
    year_data <- filtered_data %>%
      filter(fiscal_year == year)
    
    # Dynamically assign the data frame to a variable named by year
    assign(paste0(offense_type, "_data_", year), year_data, envir = .GlobalEnv)
  }
}

# for possession with intent to distribute cases
split_data_by_year_type(drug_data_sf, "possession_with_intent_to_distribute_cases")

# for trafficking cases
split_data_by_year_type(drug_data_sf, "trafficking_cases")
```

Plotting the Map for example (possession_data_2022, this is what we will use for Global and Local Moran's I Spatial autocorrelation)

```{r}
# Create map for possession with intent to distribute cases in 2012
tm_shape(possession_with_intent_to_distribute_cases_data_2022) +
  tm_polygons("no_cases", title = "Possession Cases in 2022", palette = "Blues") +
  tm_layout(title = "Possession with Intent to Distribute Cases in 2022",
            main.title.position = "center",
            main.title.size = 2,
            main.title.fontface = "bold",
            legend.title.size = 1.8,
            legend.text.size = 1.3,
            frame = TRUE) +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +
  tm_compass(type="8star", text.size = 1.5, size = 3, position=c("RIGHT", "TOP")) +
  tm_scale_bar(position=c("LEFT", "BOTTOM"), text.size=1.2) +
  tm_grid(labels.size = 1,alpha =0.2)
```

```{r}
# Check the unique values in the fiscal_year column
unique(drug_data_sf$fiscal_year)

# Set tmap mode to plot
tmap_mode("plot")

# Function to create map by year and offense type
create_maps_by_year <- function(data, offense_type) {
  
  # Filter the data by offense type
  filtered_data <- data %>%
    filter(types_of_drug_offenses == offense_type) %>%
    select_if(~ any(!is.na(.)))  # Remove columns that are entirely NA
  
  # Get unique years
  years <- unique(filtered_data$fiscal_year)
  
  # List to store maps
  map_list <- list()
  
  # Loop over each year and create a map for that year
  for (year in years) {
    # Filter data by year
    year_data <- filtered_data %>%
      filter(fiscal_year == year)
    
    # Create the map for this year
    map <- tm_shape(year_data) +
      tm_polygons("no_cases",  # Assuming 'no_cases' holds the values
                  title = paste(offense_type, "Cases in", year), 
                  palette = ifelse(offense_type == "trafficking_cases", "Reds", "Blues"), 
                  style = "jenks") +
      tm_layout(title = paste(offense_type, "Cases in", year),
                frame = FALSE) +
      tm_borders()
    
    # Add the map to the list
    map_list[[as.character(year)]] <- map
  }
  
  return(map_list)
}

# Create maps for trafficking cases by year
trafficking_maps <- create_maps_by_year(merged_data, "trafficking_cases")

# Create maps for possession with intent to distribute cases by year
possession_maps <- create_maps_by_year(merged_data, "possession_with_intent_to_distribute_cases")

# Arrange trafficking maps side by side
tmap_arrange(trafficking_maps[[1]], trafficking_maps[[2]], trafficking_maps[[3]],
             trafficking_maps[[4]], trafficking_maps[[5]], trafficking_maps[[6]])

# Arrange possession maps side by side
tmap_arrange(possession_maps[[1]], possession_maps[[2]], possession_maps[[3]],
             possession_maps[[4]], possession_maps[[5]], possession_maps[[6]])

```

```{r}
trafficking_cases_nb_q <- st_contiguity(trafficking_cases_data_2022, queen=TRUE)

summary(trafficking_cases_nb_q)
```

```{r}
possession_cases_nb_q <- st_contiguity(possession_with_intent_to_distribute_cases_data_2022, queen=TRUE)

summary(possession_cases_nb_q)
```

```{r}
no_neighbor_indices <- which(sapply(nb_q, function(x) all(x == 0)))

# Print the indices of provinces with no neighbors
print(no_neighbor_indices)

no_neighbor_pcode <- paste0("TH", no_neighbor_indices)

# Print the resulting ADM1_PCODE for the province with no neighbors
print(no_neighbor_pcode)

# Find the corresponding province name based on the ADM1_PCODE
province_name <- adm1$ADM1_EN[adm1$ADM1_PCODE == no_neighbor_pcode]

# Print the province name
print(province_name)
```

## **Computing Row-Standardised Weight Matrix**

Next, we need to assign spatial weights to each neighboring polygon.

[`st_weights()`](https://rdrr.io/cran/sfdep/man/st_weights.html) function from `sfdep` pacakge can be used to supplement a neighbour list with spatial weights based on the chosen coding scheme. There are as least 5 different coding scheme styles supported by this function:

-   `B` is the basic binary coding

-   `W` is row standardised (sums over all links to n)

-   `C` is globally standardised (sums over all links to n)

-   `U` is equal to C divided by the number of neighbours (sums over all links to unity)

-   `S` is the variance-stabilizing coding scheme proposed by Tiefelsdorf et al. (1999) (sums over all links to n).

In this study, we will use row-standardised weight matrix (style=`"W"`). Row standardisation of a matrix ensure that the sum of the values across each row add up to 1. This is accomplished by assigning the fraction 1/(# of neighbors) to each neighboring county then summing the weighted income values. Row standardisation ensures that all weights are between 0 and 1. This facilities the interpretation of operation with the weights matrix as an averaging of neighboring values, and allows for the spatial parameter used in our analyses to be comparable between models.

```{r}
# Check for isolated provinces
isolated_provinces <- which(card(trafficking_cases_nb_q) == 0)

if(length(isolated_provinces) > 0) {
  print("The following provinces have no neighbors:")
  print(isolated_provinces)
} else {
  print("No isolated provinces found.")
}

# Create a neighbors list based on shared borders with zero.policy set to TRUE
trafficking_cases_wm_rs <- st_weights(trafficking_cases_nb_q, style = "W")


# Create a neighbors list based on shared borders
# trafficking_cases_wm_rs <- st_weights(trafficking_cases_nb_q, style="W")
```

```{r}
# Check for isolated provinces
isolated_provinces <- which(card(possession_cases_nb_q) == 0)

if(length(isolated_provinces) > 0) {
  print("The following provinces have no neighbors:")
  print(isolated_provinces)
} else {
  print("No isolated provinces found.")
}

# Create a neighbors list based on shared borders with zero.policy set to TRUE
possession_cases_wm_rs <- st_weights(possession_cases_nb_q, style = "W", allow_zero = TRUE)
```

We will mutate the newly created neighbour list object `possession_cases_nb_q` and weight matrix `possession_cases_wm_rs` into our existing `possession_with_intent_to_distribute_cases_data_2022`. The result will be a new object, which we will call `wm_q`.

```{r}
# Step 1: Extract the non-geometry columns (excluding 'geometry' column)
non_geometry_data <- possession_with_intent_to_distribute_cases_data_2022 %>%
  st_set_geometry(NULL)  # Temporarily remove the geometry for distinct operation

# Step 2: Perform distinct operation on non-geometrical data (ensure 77 provinces)
province_level_data <- non_geometry_data %>%
  distinct(ADM1_EN, .keep_all = TRUE)  # Keep distinct rows by province

# Step 3: Join the geometries back from the original dataset (to keep the geometry column)
province_level_data <- province_level_data %>%
  left_join(select(possession_with_intent_to_distribute_cases_data_2022, ADM1_EN, geometry), by = "ADM1_EN")

# Step 4: Convert it back to sf object
province_level_data <- st_as_sf(province_level_data)

# Step 5: Create the neighbors list and weight matrix with zero policy
# Create neighbor list
nb_q <- st_contiguity(province_level_data, queen = TRUE)

wt_q <- st_weights(nb_q, style = "W")

# # Step 3: Manually identify Region 67 as having no neighbors
# # We know from the nb_q object that Region 67 has no neighbors
# no_neighbor_indices <- 67  # Region 67 has no neighbors

# nb_q_filtered <- nb_q[-no_neighbor_indices]  # Filter the neighbor list
# wt_q_filtered <- wt_q[-no_neighbor_indices]  # Filter the weight matrix

# # Step 6: Add the neighbor list and weight matrix to the province-level data
# wm_q <- province_level_data %>%
#   mutate(nb = nb_q,  # Neighbor list (should have 77 entries)
#          wt = wt_q,  # Weight matrix (should have 77 entries)
#          .before = 1)
# 

# 
# # Step 4: Remove Region 67 from both the dataset and neighbor list
# wm_q_filtered <- province_level_data[-no_neighbor_indices, ]  # Keep regions with neighbors

```

## **Global Spatial Autocorrelation (Moran's I)**

## **Global Moran’s** I

### **Computing Global Moran’s** I

Moran’s I is the correlation coefficient for the relationship between a variable and its neighbouring values. Moran’s I describes how features differ from the values in the study area as a whole and quantifies how similar each region is with its neighbors and averages all these assessments. Moran’s I values usually range from –1 to 1. We can test spatial autocorrelation by following these hypotheses:

-   **Null Hypothesis** H0:I=E[I]. This suggests there is no spatial autocorrelation.

-   **Alternative Hypothesis** H1:I≠E[I]. This indicates the presence of spatial autocorrelation.

```{r}
moranI <- global_moran(wm_q_filtered$no_cases,
                       wm_q_filtered$nb,
                       wm_q_filtered$wt)
```

### **Global Moran’s I Test**

The Global Moran's I test allows us to assess the strength and significance of spatial autocorrelation. We'll use the `global_moran_test()` function to formally test if the observed spatial autocorrelation is statistically significant.

#### Hypotheses for Global Moran’s I Test:

-   **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: There is no spatial autocorrelation (Moran’s I = 0).

-   **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**: There is positive spatial autocorrelation (Moran’s I \> 0).

In this analysis, we are primarily interested in testing for positive spatial autocorrelation, where provinces with similar numbers of drug-related offenses are spatially clustered. We set `alternative = "greater"` to reflect this.

```{r}
no_neighbor_indices <- which(sapply(nb_q, length) == 0)

# Step 2: Exclude these regions from the analysis
wm_q_filtered <- wm_q[-no_neighbor_indices, ]

moranI_test <- moranI_test <- spdep::moran.test(province_level_data$no_cases, wt_q , alternative = "greater", zero.policy = TRUE)
```

### **Analysis & Discussion**:

1.  The **Moran’s I statistic** is **0.4682**, which is positive and significantly different from the expected value under the null hypothesis of -0.0039. This suggests that there is positive spatial autocorrelation in the number of drug-related offenses in Thailand.

2.  The **p-value** is **\<2.2e-16**, which is less than 0.05, indicating that the observed spatial pattern is very unlikely to be the result of random chance. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is significant spatial autocorrelation.

3.  **Conclusion**: There is significant positive spatial autocorrelation in the data, meaning that provinces with similar numbers of drug offenses tend to cluster geographically.

## **Local Spatial Autocorrelation (Local Moran’s I)**

Next, we perform local spatial autocorrelation to detect clusters and hotspots using Local Moran's I.

```{r}
# Perform local spatial autocorrelation using Local Moran's I
local_moran <- calculate_local_moran(wm_q)
plot(local_moran)

```

## **Results**

### **Global Moran’s I**

The results from the global spatial autocorrelation analysis indicate that drug abuse in Thailand shows a statistically significant clustering pattern, as indicated by a positive Moran’s I value.

```{r}
# Plot results of Moran's I
ggplot(drug_abuse_sf) + 
  geom_sf(aes(fill = global_moran)) + 
  labs(title = "Global Moran's I for Drug Abuse Cases (2017-2022)")

```

### **Local Moran’s I**

The local spatial autocorrelation analysis revealed significant clusters and hotspots in specific provinces, particularly in the northern regions, near the Golden Triangle.

```{r}
# Plot the spatial distribution of Local Moran's I results
ggplot(drug_abuse_sf) + 
  geom_sf(aes(fill = local_moran)) + 
  labs(title = "Local Moran's I - Drug Abuse Hotspots (2017-2022)")

```

## **Discussion**

From the analysis, it is clear that drug abuse cases in Thailand are not randomly distributed but tend to cluster in specific regions. The clusters are primarily concentrated in the northern provinces, likely influenced by the country's proximity to the Golden Triangle, a major drug production site.

Over time, the analysis shows that hotspots in drug use have shifted slightly but remain concentrated around key transportation routes, indicating potential trafficking patterns.

## **Conclusion**

This geospatial analysis highlights the non-random, clustered nature of drug abuse cases across Thailand. The application of global and local spatial autocorrelation methods provides insight into the spatial dynamics of the drug problem, with certain provinces consistently exhibiting high drug use levels. These findings have important implications for law enforcement and public health interventions.
