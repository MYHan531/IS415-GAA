Welcome to my **IS415 Geospatial Analytics and Applications** (GAA) website! This site serves as a repository for my coursework, projects, and insights developed for the IS415 module, a core component of my final year studies in Computer Science at Singapore Management University (SMU).

## About Me

![](images/Han%20Ming%20Yan%20photo%202024.jpg){width="151"}

My name is Han Ming Yan, and I am currently in my final year as a Computer Science undergraduate at SMU. Throughout my academic journey, Iâ€™ve cultivated a strong interest in geospatial analytics, data science, and the applications of spatial data in understanding complex real-world phenomena. This course has provided a valuable opportunity to deepen my understanding of spatial data analysis, equipping me with the skills and tools to tackle complex geospatial challenges.

## Project Focus: ASEAN Geospatial Challenge 2025

This project is inspired by the ASEAN Geospatial Challenge 2025, a regional initiative supported by the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) aimed at promoting geospatial data-driven solutions to support sustainable development goals within ASEAN. Leveraging data on agriculture, industrial production, and enterprise growth, my project explores economic development patterns across Vietnam from 2012 to 2023.

By employing Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA) techniques, clustering methods, and interactive web applications, I aim to uncover regional disparities, growth hotspots, and temporal trends that can support policymakers, investors, and stakeholders in making informed decisions about regional development and resource allocation.

## Website Overview

Here, you will find different sections of my work for IS415, including:

1.  **Project Overview**: A comprehensive explanation of my research objectives, methodology, and the data sources used. This section delves into the motivations behind the project and how it aligns with the broader ASEAN Geospatial Challenge goals.

2.  **Data Preparation and Cleaning**: An overview of the steps taken to preprocess, clean, and organise data, ensuring consistency and accuracy. This section demonstrates my approach to transforming raw data into a format suitable for analysis.

3.  **Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA)**: This segment provides insights into spatial patterns in the dataset through ESDA, including maps and statistical analyses that reveal clustering and regional trends.

4.  **Interactive Shiny Application Prototype**: A prototype for an interactive Shiny app, designed to enable users to explore and analyse the spatial data dynamically. This application demonstrates how geospatial data can be made accessible to a broader audience, allowing users to adjust parameters and explore results visually.

5.  **Conclusion and Future Work**: A summary of key findings, challenges encountered, and ideas for extending the project. This section includes reflections on how the skills and insights gained from this project can be applied to future geospatial challenges.

Thank you for visiting my website. I hope this exploration of Vietnam's economic development through geospatial analysis offers valuable insights into the power of spatial data in decision-making and policy planning.
